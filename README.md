# VideoEditor

VideoEditor is a cross-platform video editing application developed using Xamarin for UWP, Android, and iOS platforms. It allows users to perform various video editing operations such as trimming, cropping, adding effects, and more. The project was initially developed as a final thesis for my Bachelor's degree and showcases the implementation of a video editing application using Xamarin.

## Technologies Used
 - C#
 - Python
 - .NET
 - Xamarin
 - REST API
 - MVVM
 - Android
 - iOS
 - UWP
 - FFmpeg
 - PhotoShop
 - XML
 - UML
 - Visio
 - GNU/Linux
 - Ubuntu

## The aim.

The aim of this code was to design and implement a cross-platform video editing application using Xamarin for UWP, Android, and iOS platforms. The UWP implementation adheres to the originally set specifications, while modifications were made to the initial specifications for the iOS and Android platforms. These modifications involved outsourcing video processing operations to a development server.

At the time of the thesis, there were no existing cross-platform video editing applications for UWP, Android, and iOS platforms implemented using Xamarin. Hence, the project's implementation using Xamarin is considered sufficient as a final thesis. Although Xamarin support ended on May 1, 2024, its successor, .NET MAUI, provides a similar functionality and allows developers to migrate their code from Xamarin.Forms to .NET MAUI. The thesis includes a decision process and its results, justifying the use of Xamarin.Forms technologies during development instead of .NET MAUI.

The implementation of the project builds upon the knowledge acquired during my university bachelor's degree. It utilizes engineering and IT skills to solve an engineering problem, demonstrating my capabilities in solving real-world challenges.

## Usage 

To use the VideoEditor application, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/kaszasat/VideoEditor.git
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio or your preferred development environment.
3. Build the solution to restore NuGet packages and compile the code.
4. Select the desired platform (UWP, Android, or iOS) and deploy the application to the corresponding emulator or device.
5. Once the application is launched, you can explore the various video editing features and functionalities provided by VideoEditor.
